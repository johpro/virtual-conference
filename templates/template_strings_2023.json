Transfer to the city centre is via SkyBus (https://www.skybus.com.au/melbourne-city-express/), a bus service that runs frequently 24-hours, 7 days a week.  SkyBus is well signposted in the airport.  Tickets can be purchased online, via the app, or at e-kiosks outside the terminal.  The bus takes you to Southern Cross train station in the city centre.  Travel by tram within the city centre is free within the Free Tram Zone (https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PDFs/Maps/Network-maps/5b4a3efe80/PTV-Free-Tram-Zone-Map.pdf), though note that the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition tram stop is just outside the free zone.  More information on Melbourne can be found on the VIS 2023 Destination webpage (https://www.ieeevis.org/year/2023/destination).\nCredit cards can be used everywhere throughout Melbourne for payment.  VISA and Mastercard are widely accepted, though Amex is not available in many places.  Cash in Australian dollars can be withdrawn from ATMs for debit cards, though cash is not necessary and many Melbournians don’t carry cash.\nIf you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to email the Tech chairs:\ntech@ieeevis.org.\n \nBest regards,\nIEEE VIS 2023 Tech Chairs\nJohannes Knittel, Kadek Satriadi, John Thompson, John Wenskovitch\n",

The session chair will be in the room and take questions from the audience. For the few presentations that are pre-recorded, the Q&A can occur asynchronously in the Discord channel for your session’s track.  \n__At the end of your session.__ There is a hard cut-off 10 minutes after the session is scheduled to end to allow time to set up the next session, so please keep to the session schedule.

This email contains information for a conference session below in which you are a student volunteer. You will receive one such email per session. Please contact the Tech Committee or Student Volunteer Chairs with any questions. For the quickest responses from the Tech Committee, we recommend using the Discord channel #tech-issues-internal.\nThe majority of all presentations are in person with all Q&A happening over microphone to be handled by the session chair. Please assist the session chair or event organiser when needed. \nDue to exceptional circumstances, a few authors can not travel and their pre-recorded video will be played by the session chair. Questions to authors who are presenting remotely will be encouraged to be submitted to Discord. Some remote presentations may occur during accepted workshops and associated events. These instances are being arranged by the event organisers. There is limited technical help provided for these presenters, given the conference is in-person first. There will be no virtual attendees.\n## Webapp for Tech and Student Volunteers\nThis year we have a webapp that will help you by providing all information you might need for running a session or track in one central place. This app contains the run-of-show (ROS) for your session. Please check it out before the session to get acquainted with it.\nPlease DO NOT SHARE Web App links!\nRun-of-Show Web App: {RoS URL}\nPreparing the Session\nPlease come to the session room 15 minutes before the session and make sure you have access to the run of show of the respective session. Identify the Session Chair and ask them what assistance they need.\n## Running the Session\nAs an SV running the session, your job is to be attentive to all of the presentations and to assist with any presentation-related issues. Be ready to assist with the laptop/podium connections, if there are minor technical issues (or send a notification via #tech-issues-internal on Discord if it’s a larger problem or an audio problem. You may have to go to reception to find the conference centre technician). During the Question & Answers after each presentation, help direct attendees to the microphone in the room. If the presenter has any materials to hand out or needs assistance moving chairs, it is the SV’s responsibility to help. If the SV is physically unable to help, they should message the SV Day Captain on Slack and we will send a Standby SV from the SV Room.\nIf there are any remote presentations, ask the Session Chair if they plan to answer remote questions live. If so, ask the Session Chair if they need assistance monitoring questions coming in over Discord. They may choose to handle that themselves. Otherwise, the remote presenter is responsible for answering Discord questions in their own time.\n \nSession Schedule \n* Session: {desc}\n* Session Date: {date}\n* Assigned Start: {starttime} (AEDT UTC+11)\n* Assigned End: {endtime} (AEDT UTC+11)\n* Session Chairs: {Session Chairs}\n* Session Chairs Emails: {Session Chairs Emails}\n* Session Content Page: https://content.ieeevis.org/year/2023/session_{Session ID}.html\n* Session Room: {Room Name}\n* Session ID: {Session ID}\n* Discord URL: {Discord URL}\n## Additional Information\nPlease attend the SV briefing sessions on Sunday morning 7:30am-8:30am in the SV room, room O101, for more details and questions. \nIf you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to email the Tech Chairs: tech@ieeevis.org.\n \nBest regards,\nIEEE VIS 2023 Tech Chairs\nJohannes Knittel, Kadek Satriadi, John Thompson, John Wenskovitch\n",

Please assist the session chair or event organiser when needed. </p><p> Due to exceptional circumstances, a few authors can not travel and their pre-recorded video will be played by the session chair. Questions to authors who are presenting remotely will be encouraged to be submitted to Discord. Some remote presentations may occur during accepted workshops and associated events. These instances are being arranged by the event organisers. There is limited technical help provided for these presenters, given the conference is in-person first. There will be no virtual attendees. </p><h3 style='color:#c47000;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:16px;line-height:150%;text-align:left;margin: 4px 0;'> Webapp for Student Volunteers</h3> <p>IThis year we have a webapp that will help you by providing all information you might need for running a session or track in one central place. This app contains the run-of-show (ROS) for your session. Please check it out before the session to get acquainted with it. <strong>Please DO NOT SHARE Web App links!</strong></p><blockquote> <p>Run-of-Show Web App: <strong>{RoS URL}</strong> </p></blockquote> <h3 style='color:#c47000;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:16px;line-height:150%;text-align:left;margin: 4px 0;'> Instructions </h3> <p> <em>Preparing the session.</em> Please come to the session room 15 minutes before the session and make sure you have access to the run of show of the respective session. Identify the Session Chair and ask them what assistance they need. </p><p> <em>Running the session.</em> As an SV running the session, your job is to be attentive to all of the presentations and to assist with any presentation-related issues. Be ready to assist with the laptop/podium connections, if there are minor technical issues (or send a notification via #tech-issues-internal on Discord if it’s a larger problem or an audio problem. You may have to go to reception to find the conference centre technician). During the Question & Answers after each presentation, help direct attendees to the microphone in the room. If the presenter has any materials to hand out or needs assistance moving chairs, it is the SV’s responsibility to help. If the SV is physically unable to help, they should message the SV Day Captain on Slack and we will send a Standby SV from the SV Room. </p><p> <em>In case of remote presentations.</em> If there are any remote presentations, ask the Session Chair if they plan to answer remote questions live. If so, ask the Session Chair if they need assistance monitoring questions coming in over Discord. They may choose to handle that themselves. Otherwise, the remote presenter is responsible for answering Discord questions in their own time. </p><h3 style='color:#c47000;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:16px;line-height:150%;text-align:left;margin: 4px 0;'> Session Schedule </h3> <blockquote> <p>Session: <strong>{desc}</strong></p><p>Date: <strong>{date}</strong></p><p>Session Start: <strong>{starttime} AEDT (UTC+11)</strong></p><p>Session Start: <strong>{endtime} AEDT (UTC+11)</strong></p><p>Session Chairs: <strong>{Session Chairs}</strong></p><p>Session Chairs Emails: <strong>{Session Chairs Emails}</strong></p><p>Session Content Page: <strong><a href='https://content.ieeevis.org/year/2023/session_{Session ID}.html' style='color:#c47000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;border-bottom-color:rgb(196, 112, 0);border-bottom-style:dashed;border-bottom-width:1px;'> https://content.ieeevis.org/year/2023/session_{Session ID}.html </a></strong></p><p>Session Room: <strong>{location}</strong></p><p>Room Discord: <strong><a href='{Discord URL}' style='color:#c47000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;border-bottom-color:rgb(196, 112, 0);border-bottom-style:dashed;border-bottom-width:1px;'>Discord URL</a></strong></p></blockquote> <p> If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to email the Tech Chairs: <a href='mailto:tech@ieeevis.org' style='color:#c47000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;border-bottom-color:rgb(196, 112, 0);border-bottom-style:dashed;border-bottom-width:1px;'>tech@ieeevis.org</a>. </p><p> Best regards, </p><p style='margin: 4px 0;'>IEEE VIS 2023 Tech Chairs</p><p style='margin: 4px 0;'>Johannes Knittel, Kadek Satriadi, John Thompson, and John Wenskovitch</p><div style='padding: 32px 0'></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></center></div>"

We strongly encourage presenters to test the audio-visual set-up during that time to ensure smooth sailing during their session. You can either use your own laptop (PC or Mac), or bring your slides on a USB flash drive. All rooms are equipped with a smart lectern with inbuilt presentation computer. An audiovisual technician will be on hand to assist if you encounter any issues; please see them at the AV desk (next to the registration desk) for assistance.\n__Before your presentation.__ Please come to the session room 15 minutes before the session. Search for your session chair. The session chair will indicate when it is time to wrap up your presentation. \n__Live Q&A.__ After each talk there will be a live Q&A portion, depending on the session structure (associated events and workshops may vary). The session chair will be in the room and take questions from the audience. For the few presentations that are pre-recorded, the Q&A can occur asynchronously in the Discord channel for your session’s track.  \n__At the end of your session.__ There is a hard cut-off 10 minutes after the session is scheduled to end to allow time to set up the next session, so please keep to the session schedule.

In addition, the conference also provides a practice room for presenters (Room 206). If you would like to practice your talk ahead of your session, please sign up at the registration desk. Practice room bookings are for 30-minute time slots between 8:00AM to 5:00PM from Monday to Thursday. We encourage you to be proactive in reserving a time slot: this room tends to fill up quickly.\nIf you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to email the Tech Chairs: tech@ieeevis.org.\nBest regards,\nIEEE VIS 2023 Tech Chairs\nJohannes Knittel, Kadek Satriadi, John Thompson, John Wenskovitch\n",
